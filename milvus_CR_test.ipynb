    "1. Using definitions from the Medical Device Regulation in the MDR_3Columns.csv\n",
    "    * embeddings were created, for each definition, with the library \"sentence-transformers\".\n",
    "2. Storing those embeddings in the vector db along with metadata.\n",
    "3. Creating pipeline to pass a query and retrieve similar records.\n",
    "    * the query was created by selecting a sequence of characters of random length in random rows of MDR_3Columns.csv\n",
    "4. Updating vector db index with new records\n",
    "5. Deleting records from vector db index.\n",
    "6. Storing information about latency and using HNSW to search for results as this strategy seems to be the most used.\n",

    "### Considerations about using Milvus in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Recommended tools:**\n",
    "\n",
    " - Anaconda to create a python virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.anaconda.com/download/\n",
    "\n",
    " - Visual Studio Code to work with the scripts:\n",
    "\n",
    " https://code.visualstudio.com/download\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Installation:**\n",
    "\n",
    " - Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):\n",
    "\n",
    " https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install\n",
    "\n",
    " - Docker:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/\n",
    "\n",
    " - Run the docker-compose.yml following the instructions here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md\n",
    "\n",
    "when pip installing pymilvus, grpcio (setup.py) times out.\n",
    "\n",
    " * One solution is to create environment with python 3.7.0\n",
    "\n",
    "and to pip install pymilvus==2.3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "other dependencies in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install sentence-transformers to create embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **detailed steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. create a virtual environment (MDRassistant is the name of the environment):\n",
    "\n",
    "conda create -n MDRassistant python=3.7.0 \n",
    "\n",
    "2. activate the newly created conda environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "conda activate MDRassistant\n",
    "\n",
    "3. install python packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "conda install -n MDRassistant ipykernel --update-deps --force-reinstall\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install pymilvus==2.3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install sentence-transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The query vector needs to be a nested list or nested array of vector(s). E.g. query = [[vector]] or queries = [[query_vector1],[query_vector2],...]\n",
    "\n",
    "When inserting data into a collection with the method insert(), it is necessary to call the flush() method afterwards. Otherwise, the collection is not indexed unless the amount of data inserted reaches a certain number and the collection is 'sealed'. Calling flush() seales the collection. In practice, Milvus recommends to not call flush() too often to avoid segmenting the storage which could create computationally inneficient search.\n",
